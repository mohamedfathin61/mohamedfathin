# Portfolio + Data Analytics Dashboard

This is a single-page portfolio and analytics dashboard demo with a premium 3D motion UI and glossy glass effect. It's built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript and uses Chart.js (CDN) for charts.

Features
- Dark glassmorphism UI with neon accents
- 3D hover (tilt) on cards and micro-interactions
- Parallax background layers
- Animated page transitions (fade + slide + scale)
- Responsive layout: left sidebar on desktop, bottom nav on mobile
- Interactive charts with dummy data (skills, monthly activity, engagement)

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required).

Tips
- For the best visual effect use a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, or Safari).
- The project uses `Chart.js` via CDN; no additional setup required.

Files
- `index.html` – main markup
- `styles.css` – styles and layout
- `script.js` – interactions and charts

If you'd like, I can:
- Add export/CSV or simulated data fetching
- Include more themed pages or a projects detail modal
- Bundle into a small dev server and add live reload
